This project focuses on classifying heart stroke occurrences using a heavily imbalanced dataset. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify potential heart stroke cases. Given the dataset's imbalance, we employ various techniques such as resampling, synthetic data generation, and advanced machine learning algorithms to address the skewed class distribution. The ultimate goal is to ensure reliable and effective predictions that can aid in early diagnosis and prevention of heart strokes.
